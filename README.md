### quick  note
this a simple mutli video player setup built around opencv and udev (for updating content when a properly formated  usb key is inserted).
it play video in loop and change the payed video on  keyboard input (in this case a makey-makey).

the code is quick'n'dirty and use standard unix mechanism to autostart as soon as the device is up and running (rc.local and xinit).
